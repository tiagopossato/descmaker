# DEScMaker

This tool can parse a "Waters/Supremica" file (.wmod) and generate a C code with the same structure of the inside supervisors and distinguishers.

The code generated is independent and don't any requeriment.

# How to use

## Pre-requisites

### Windows

Install python3.

Open Powershell as administrator and run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
Select 'Y' and press enter.

run ```setup_win.ps1``` with Powershell to create virtual environment and install dependencies.


#### Windows alternative

### Linux
run ```setup_linux.sh``` with bash to create virtual environment and install dependencies.
 
### Supremica
- For convenience, when synthesizing a supervisor, mark the 'Rename states' option.
- Before send supervisor 'To editor', 'Rename automaton' to remove caracteres and spaces. Keep only letters and numbers.
- Do not name a supervisor as 'supervisor'
- The name of all distinguishers MUST start with GD. For example, GD1, GD2, GDwhatever, etc.
- As one would anticipate, it is imperative that no other components bear nomenclature commencing with 'GD'.

## Generate code

### Windows

run `app\descmaker.ps1 -i <input> -o <output>` with Powershell to execute the software:
-  `-i <input>`: input file (required)
-  `-o <output>`: output directory. Default: 'generated_code'
 
### Linux

run `app\descmaker.sh -i <input> -o <output> -e -h` with terminal to execute the software:
- `-i <input>` : input file (required)
- `-o <output>` : output directory. Default: generated_code
- `-e` : in Linux, if present, compile with cmake/gcc and execute the generated code. Default: no execution
- `-h` : help

The script will generate a structure with the same name of the output directory. The folder will contain the generated code, organized in the same structure of the `base_code`. Inside generated code also will be a `README.md` with the instructions to run the code. Now, this can be readed in `app/base_code/README.md`.

# Adding path to the system
add the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/path-to-project/app
```
than run `source ~/.bashrc` to reload the file.
